= Paid Ruby bindings

== Installation

gem 'paid'

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7 or above. (Ruby 1.8.6 may work if you load
  ActiveSupport.) For Ruby versions before 1.9.2, you'll need to add this to your Gemfile:

    if Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION) < Gem::Version.new('1.9.2')
      gem 'rest-client', '~> 1.6.8'
    end


* rest-client, json

== Mirrors

The paid gem is mirrored on Rubygems, so you should be able to
install it via <tt>gem install paid</tt> if desired.

Note that if you are installing via bundler, you should be sure to use the https
rubygems source in your Gemfile, as any gems fetched over http could potentially be
compromised in transit and alter the code of gems fetched securely over https:

  source 'https://rubygems.org'

  gem 'rails'
  gem 'paid'

== Development

Test cases can be run with: `bundle exec rake test`
